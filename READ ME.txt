Dear MCPS/iboss employees on my github(I know you're on here. A website of mine got blocked over the weekend.),

Hello!
How much do you get paid? 
Do you really think this is an effective use of company time?
Stalking a random guy's off campus, off of school hours github repos?
Is that even legal? If you guys discipline me, there is legal precedent for ya guys to get in trouble, ya know.

You guys should address some actual problems on your school wifi. Such as repl.it being blocked when it is legitemately just a coding website.
If you are a MCPS employee and you have control over iboss filtering, I promise, that if you address the repl.it issue, and inform me about it (via through GitHub or I find out about it on my own), I will stop making game websites and new URLS. And I'll get my friend to stop as well.

Thank you!

Your work doesn't go unappreciated.
